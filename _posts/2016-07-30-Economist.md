## UN fit? Malcolm Turnbull's dilemma

Australia's prime minister faces a tricky decision this week. His conservative Liberal government is due to consider nominating Kevin Rudd, a former Labor prime minster, as United Nations secretary-general to succeed Ban Ki-moon when the General Assembly meets in September. A China scholar and foreign-policy expert , Mr Rudd has been lobbying UN members for the job. But the needs Australia's formal nomination , and his quarrelsome past clouds his candidacy. Mr Turnbull's government is divided : one rightist member calls him a" megalomaniac", while a former Liberal leader brands him "made for the job". One poll suggests that Australians perfer Helen Clark, a former New Zealand prime minister .The UN tends to rotate the global region from which it selects its leader, so an east European candidate might be favoured . Australia's pick might act as a compromise candidate if that isn't clear-cut. Mr Rudd's candidacy would require some compromise at home too.

## Booster shot: Abenomics redux 

After its policy meeting today the Band of Japan is expected to announce more quantitative easing: its latest attempt to boost the economy and generate inflation. Haruhiko Kuroda , its governer, may not spin the printing presses as the government might like(helicopter money). But the needs to reassure markets, and to prevent the yen from stengthening further , as it has since the Brexit vote. 
More easing would also reinforce the stimulus package announced this week by Shinzo Abe, the prime minister. It may mean cranking down already negative interest rates on bank reserves and buying a wider range of assets- more government bonds and equity and real-estate funds. GPIF, Japan's giant pension fund, which in 2014 upped its equity holdings, is expected to announce large losses today.: it too could do with a lift. Japan's economy needs not only more monetary and fiscal loosening but also Mr Abe's long-promised structural reforms.

## The world in brief 

**Russia's** security service said it had foiled two attempts by armed Ukrainians to enter Crimea, the terriory Russia annexed from Ukrainians in 2014. The FSB said one of its operatives and a Russian soldier were killed in border skirmishes, and accused Ukrainians of trying to destagbilise the region ahead of Septemper's Russian parliamentary elections. Ukraine dismissed the allegations, calling them 'fake information'. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**South Sudan** rejected a proposal to send 4000 more United Nations troops to the country ; fearful of a "UN protectorate ", it argues for an independent peacekeeping force. Violent clashes nationwide, a particularly in Juba, the captial, have heightened concerns about a return to civil war. South Sudan's government has already seized the passports of dozens of UN workers.


In a 15 hour session Brazil's Senate coted 59-21 in favour of an impeachment trial for **Dilma Rousseff** , the country's embattled president. In May Ms Rousseff was suspended, osensibly for dodgy accounting practice, after a similarly drawn-ou debate. Another vote after the Olympics will require a two-third majority to convict her; Michel Temer, the vice-president and interim leader, would serve out her term.

The NASDAQ and S&P 500 **stockmarket indices** touched record highs after weak productivity figures , seemd to make a rate-rise by the Federal Reserve less likely. The MSCI global index also hit a one-year high. Meanwhile, yields on nearterm British gocernment bonds turned negative after the Bank of England, which is buying bonds to stimulate the economy , could not find enough of them.


**Intel** agreed to buy **Nervana Systems** , a starup that offers a could-based  machine-learning system, for around $400m. The world's largest chipmaker is betting that machine learning(a branch of artificial intelligence) will become increasingly important in corporate data centres.

**Tesla** said one of its cars had been involed in a crash in Beijing while in "Autopilot" mode, the first known incident of its kind in China. THe car's owner, who was uninjured, said sales staff had overstated the extent to which the car could drive itself. Tesla said the data showd the driver had not kept his hand on the wheel, as recommended when using Autopilot.
