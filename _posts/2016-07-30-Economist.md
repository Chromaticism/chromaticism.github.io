## UN fit? Malcolm Turnbull's dilemma

Australia's prime minister faces a tricky decision this week. His conservative Liberal government is due to consider nominating Kevin Rudd, a former Labor prime minster, as United Nations secretary-general to succeed Ban Ki-moon when the General Assembly meets in September. A China scholar and foreign-policy expert , Mr Rudd has been lobbying UN members for the job. But the needs Australia's formal nomination , and his quarrelsome past clouds his candidacy. Mr Turnbull's government is divided : one rightist member calls him a" megalomaniac", while a former Liberal leader brands him "made for the job". One poll suggests that Australians perfer Helen Clark, a former New Zealand prime minister .The UN tends to rotate the global region from which it selects its leader, so an east European candidate might be favoured . Australia's pick might act as a compromise candidate if that isn't clear-cut. Mr Rudd's candidacy would require some compromise at home too.

## Booster shot: Abenomics redux 

After its policy meeting today the Band of Japan is expected to announce more quantitative easing: its latest attempt to boost the economy and generate inflation.

But the needs to reassure markets, and to prevent the yen from stengthening further , as it has since the Brexit vote. 
More easing would also reinforce the stimulus package announced this week by Shinzo Abe, the prime minister. It may mean cranking down already negative interest rates on bank reserves and buying a wider range of assets- more government bonds and equity and real-estate funds. GPIF, Japan's giant pension fund, which in 2014 upped its equity holdings, is expected to announce large losses today.: it too could do with a lift. Japan's economy needs not only more monetary and fiscal loosening but also Mr Abe's long-promised structural reforms.
